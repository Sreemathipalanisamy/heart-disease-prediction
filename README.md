Heart Disease Prediction 

This project involves predicting heart disease using Logistic Regression. 
We utilize the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which contains various medical attributes. First, we load the dataset and visualize the distribution of patients affected by Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). We then split the data into training and testing sets. A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training data and used to make predictions on the test data. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Finally, we visualize the confusion matrix to understand the model's performance better.
