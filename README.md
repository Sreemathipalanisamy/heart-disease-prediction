## Description
The **Heart Disease Prediction System** analyzes patient health data and predicts the presence of **coronary heart disease (CHD)** using a **Logistic Regression** model. The system leverages **data visualization, statistical analysis, and classification metrics** to provide insights into heart disease risks.

## Features
- 📊 **Loads and processes** patient medical data from a dataset
- 📈 **Visualizes** the distribution of affected and non-affected patients
- 🏥 **Uses Logistic Regression** for predictive analysis
- 🔍 **Evaluates model performance** using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- 🌡 **Displays heatmaps** to illustrate prediction results

## Installation
To run the **Heart Disease Prediction System** locally, follow these steps:

### **1. Clone the repository:**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
```

### **2. Navigate to the project directory:**
```sh
cd heart-disease-prediction
```

### **3. Install dependencies:**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Run the script:**
```sh
python heart_disease.py
```

## Usage
Once the application is running:

1. 🏥 **The system loads patient medical data.**
2. 📊 **A visualization is displayed, showing the distribution of affected and non-affected patients.**
3. ⚙ **The Logistic Regression model trains on the dataset and predicts heart disease presence.**
4. ✅ **The results include accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.**
